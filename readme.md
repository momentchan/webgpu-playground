## About

This project is a React Three Fiber port of the ASCII shader tutorial by [Yuri Artiukh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxeRcnLr0ko). It demonstrates how to create an ASCII art effect using WebGPU and Three.js Shading Language (TSL).

This is a personal practice project for learning WebGPU and TSL (Three.js Shading Language).

## Features

- ASCII shader effect using WebGPU
- Real-time texture processing (scene texture or uploaded images)
- Barrel distortion control
- Interactive controls via Leva
- Texture upload support
- Customizable ASCII character rendering with gradient colors

## Tech Stack

- React Three Fiber
- Three.js (WebGPU renderer)
- Three.js Shading Language (TSL)
- Leva (for UI controls)
